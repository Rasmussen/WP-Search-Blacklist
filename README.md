# WordPress-Search-Words-Blacklist
A useful function to filter out (404) some spamming and explicit keywords in the WordPress search feature. 
Use as is (free plugin) or add the included function at the end of the Wordpress functions.php file.
Feel free to edit the redirect part and the swear words list by forking this project on GitHub.
